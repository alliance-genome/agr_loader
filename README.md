# Alliance of Genome Resources Loader
An initial loader prototype for the web portal of the Alliance of Genome
Resources.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker-compose (can be installed via `pip`: `pip install docker-compose`).
- neo4j-driver (can be installed via `pip`: `pip install neo4j-driver`).  
## Installation
- Build the local image with `make build`.
- Start the Neo4j database with `make startdb`. Allow ~10 seconds for Neo4j to initialize.
  - The Docker volume `agrloader_storedb` will be created (if it does not already exist).
  - To initialize an empty database after previously using the loader, be sure to run `make removedb` **before** running `make startdb`.

## Running the Loader
- Initialize a full load with `make run`.
- Alternatively, `make run_test` will launch a much smaller test load; this is useful for development and testing.
- make test runs removedb, startdb, build and run_test in one command.

## Accessing the Neo4j shell
- From your command line: `docker exec -ti neo4j_nqc bin/cypher-shell`
  - A quick command to count the number of nodes in your db: `match (n) return count (n);`

## Stopping and Removing the Database
- Once finished, stop the database with `make stopdb`.
- Optionally, remove the database with `make removedb`.
